            <b>Fairy</b>
            <p>
                Over hill, over dale,<br>
                Thorough bush, thorough brier,<br>
                Over park, over pale,<br>
                Thorough flood, thorough fire,<br>
                I do wander everywhere,<br>
                Swifter than the moon's sphere;<br>
                And I serve the fairy queen,<br>
                To dew her orbs upon the green.<br>
                The cowslips tall her pensioners be:<br>
                In their gold coats spots you see;<br>
                Those be rubies, fairy favours,<br>
                In those freckles live their savours:<br>
                I must go seek some dewdrops here<br>
                And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.<br>
                Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone:<br>
                Our queen and all our elves come here anon.<br>
            </p>
            <b>PUCK</b>
            <p>
                The king doth keep his revels here to-night:<br>
                Take heed the queen come not within his sight;<br>
                For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,<br>
                Because that she as her attendant hath<br>
                A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;<br>
                She never had so sweet a changeling;<br>
                And jealous Oberon would have the child<br>
                Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;<br>
                But she perforce withholds the loved boy,<br>
                Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:<br>
                And now they never meet in grove or green,<br>
                By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,<br>
                But, they do square, that all their elves for fear<br>
                Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.<br>
